# Abstraction:
# hiding the unnecessary detail o secret detail of a class and showing only the essentials to user

# Example:
# In problem.py how the average is calculated is not an essential thing to show so abstraction is done over there


# Encapsulation:
# Wrapping data and functions into single unit(object)
